My project will use two APIs - the Datamuse API and the Dad Jokes API.
The Datamuse API will be used to find synonyms for a word that the user inputs into the search function. Once the
synonyms are found, the Dad Jokes API will be used to find a joke that incorporates one of the synonyms. my web
application will have a search bar where the user can input a word. Once the user submits the word, the application will
make a request to the Datamuse API to find synonyms for the word. The response from the API will be parsed to extract a
random synonym. Once the synonym is obtained, the application will make a request to the Dad Jokes API, passing the
synonym as a parameter in the search query. The API will respond with a list of jokes that include the synonym. The
application will then randomly select one of the jokes and display it on the page.
To make the web application responsive, you will use media queries to adjust the layout and styling of the page for
different screen sizes.
